				<p>
				<br>
		 		In this game, the protagonist is on a direct flight from Washington D.C. to Buenos Aires, in Argentina, to spend the honeymoon with his wife. Due to a turbine engine failure, the pilot is forced to make an emergency landing. The only point where it can be done is in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. The impact on the ground is very violent that the aircraft brakes into two parts and the rear part starts to burn. For most of the passengers there was no escape. 
		 		<br><br>
		 		There are only five survivors, him, his wife and three other guys. Everybody is panicked, they try to can call for help from the cockpit but all radio communications are cut off and there is no other way than try to repair it. The protagonist will have to survive as long as possible, hoping that someone will be able to trace where the plane crashed. During all this time he will run into some dangers and obstacles in which he will have to make decisions. In fact, he will have to decide whether to trust his companions and help each other or whether to rely only on his wife. 
		 		<br><br>
		 		The three guys, because the resources were running out, will start panicking and try to steal all the food and water left. These choices, if wrong, could lead the player to die and to restart the game from the beginning. Therefore, to survive, he will have to find food and water in the forest, but to do this he will come across hungry predators who will try to attack him. He will have to choose whether to fight them or to run away. 
		 		<br><br>
		 		To obtain useful materials for his survival, he will have to solve mini-games. Those materials will help him a lot. If the protagonist makes appropriate choices, he will be able to rebuild the radio system and call for help to go back home.
